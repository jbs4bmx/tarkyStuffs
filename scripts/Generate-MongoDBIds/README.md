# Generate MongoDB IDs
A quick and dirty script to generate a given number of MongoDB IDs. With the help of ChatGPT, I wrote this to generate the IDs I would need for my custom item mods for Single Player Tarkov.

## Notes
Requires PowerShell 7+ to function.
Earlier versions of PowerShell do not have the necessary modules to perform the generation functions within this script.
