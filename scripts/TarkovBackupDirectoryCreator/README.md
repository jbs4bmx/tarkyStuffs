# Tarkov Backup Directory Creator

Create folders to organize each backup.

Name the folder what ever you like. I prefer to use the current client version as the name of the folder.

The script creates 3 folders inside:
* client.bkup
* mods.bkup
* modules.bkup

## Preview

This is what you'll see if you enter in only a folder name:
![noPath Image](./img/tbdc.noPath.png)

And this is what you'll see if you enter in a full path:
![yesPath Image](./img/tbdc.yesPath.png)

### Enjoy!
