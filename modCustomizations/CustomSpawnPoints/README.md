# Lua-CustomSpawnPoints (Modified by jbs4bmx)

## What is this?
This is an enhanced modification of Custom Spawn Points by Lua. I have added all custom spawn points of other authors to the main configuration files of this mod.

This is not for the faint of heart. The diverse spawn options for bots/players means that you could run into enemies nearly everywhere on each of these maps (hopefully?).

## What did you do?
I combined the following customizations into this one mod:

  2. Extended Bot Spawnpoints by Lavax
  3. Player Spawns (That Make Sense) by MrW0LF
  4. More AI Spawns on Factory by Harry Potter
  5. Custom Spawn Points - Customs by Lua
  6. Custom Spawns for Streets by Solarint

## What is your goal?
I want it all. I want massive amounts of bot/player spawn points so that playing the game feels more random and there are less "pockets" of enemies.

I wanted to provide a simple experience for everyone. Just install and go wild. No need to configure anything as it is already configured out of the box.

I hope that the original developers of these mods continue their work as these are brilliant additions to the community. I appreciate all work that has gone into these mods/customizations and I hope that each developer knows just how much their time and dedication are appreciated.

## Credits
I do not take credit for any of this. All credit goes to the developers that created the mods in the first place. The only thing I did was compile it | configure it | and then share my build of it.

Peace and long life.
